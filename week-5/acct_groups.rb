 # Pseudocode:
 # The input is a group of people.
 # The output is groups of 4 or people or last 3 people.
 # I will do the following steps:
 # I going to create a method that will take one big list of people and name "people".
 # Then will initiate another list that will contain groups with people inside of of each group.
 # I will make each group has 5 people or last 3, I want the names unsorted.
 # I will then proceed to print each group with their corresponding names.

# What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?
# Having people in a group was the most difficult because I was having repetitions before 
# I figured the correct way to do that.

# Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?
# Yes, I am really improving day by day, sometimes I have to different direction than my pseudocode,
# but at leat It helps you start somewhere.

# Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?
# I think I have done the solid basics my method will automatically create groups, I can 
# also makes it print groups in alphabetical orders but I chose not to, If I knew how to implement a user
# interface and a database, if would have been much better.

# What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?
# I decided to go with hashes because you can have a key with multiple values which in my case would be
# groups and people.

# What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?
# I learn to initialize a hash with a key that could take many values, it gave me the opportunity to review 
# many methods while was researching.
