###What is a one-to-one database?
It is when a thing only have relationship with another thing and vice versa. for example, a person can only have on social security number and social security number can be assigned to only on person. 
###When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
I would not use if not necessary to help the keep the database less complex.
###What is a many-to-many database?
We have many to many relationship if a data have multiples relationship with other data and vice versa. for instance, a teacher can have many students and a student can have many teachers.
###When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
Yes, most of the time a database would require the use of a many-to-many relationships, I think it's one of the most common type of relationships because in real life database, things can have the same properties almost all the time.
###What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
So far I found nothing confusing about schemas maybe I haven't seen complex enough databes yet
to be confused. The primary key and the foreign make sense as they make it easy to identify the type of relationships between entities.
