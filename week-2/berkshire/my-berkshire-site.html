<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was a great experience. It gave the opportunity to put in practice what I have learned so far. And it was a bit challenging but I had fun with it.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Researching was easy; there are a lot of resources that talk about semantic HTML5 elements. Using them is really helpful because they are meaningful for example, <header>.<footer>,<table><nav> all offer a direct meaning of their function. There it makes web developers' life easier.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML).
I tried to establish a good skeleton while staying away from formatting

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
According to my research HTML comes with a great improvements. It brings new refinements that makes web developing even easier, especially for a beginner like myself.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I try to implement the very basics of a web page to start with such as: he Html tags, the head tags, the title tags, and the body tags. From there I try to remember what type of contents should go in each of these tags.
