###What does puts do?
Puts display the output of a code in a new line.

###What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a whole number while a float are nubers with decimal points.

###What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
A float division is when we want want the exact result with a decimal point if necessary while an Integer division is when we just want a rounded number, for example; if you divide 5 t-shirts between 2 people they would each have 2 t-shirts not 2.5 t-shirts. 

```

one_day_hours = 24
one_year_days = 365
hours_in_years = one_year_days * one_day_hours
puts hours_in_years



one_day_minutes = 60 * 24
one_year_minutes = one_day_minutes * 365
minutes_in_decade = one_year_minutes * 10
puts minutes_in_decade

```
###How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Ruby handle these operations by computing the values and the result is put in a place holder such as a variable. in the case of division, with integers we get a whole number as result while with float we a result with a decimal point.

###What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
In Ruby, strings are anything between a single or double quotes.

###What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
Variables are place holders that hold values. 

###How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
This challenge was interesting because it gave me the opportunity to review basic things that I had forgotten. I really got a good review.
